Tensors have different meanings to different people.

So why not abstract the differences into _Tensor Spaces_. Now all it means to be a tensor is...
> A tensor is an element of a tensor space.

## Install

#### Downloading Latest Release

The latest release of TensorSpace can be downloaded as either a `tar.gz` or `zip` file here:

[Latest Release](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TensorSpace/releases/latest) 


#### Linux and Mac users

We will assume your directory for Magma packages is titled `my_magma_packages` but replace this name if it is different. You can create this directory with:
```
$ mkdir my_magma_packages
```
Download `TensorSpace-x.y.tar.gz` from the latest release into `my_magma_package`. Then you could run the following to unzip TensorSpace and install the package.
```
$ cd my_magma_packages
$ gzip TensorSpace-x.y.zip
$ sh TensorSpace/install.sh
```

This may install further packages necessary in `my_magma_packages`. It may also modify your Magma start file (`~/.magmarc`) so that these packages are available at the start of a Magma session. To avoid this, use the manual installation instructions below.


#### Manually

Currently, we do not have an install file compatible with Windows. 

Attach the spec file during a Magma run and the intrinsics will be available
to use.  To attach the spec file, run the following, where `<location>` is the directory containing TensorSpace,
```
> AttachSpec("<location>/TensorSpace/TensorSpace.spec");
```


## Update

#### Linux and Mac users

To update the package and all its dependencies, run the following shell command.
```
$ sh TensorSpace/update.sh
```

#### Manually

We currently do not have an update file compatible for Windows. 

To manually update, either download the latest release, see [here](#Downloading-Latest-Release), or pull from GitHub with the following.
```
$ cd TensorSpace/
$ git pull origin master
```


## Uninstall

This package can be removed entirely by deleting the folder into which it was downloaded and removing the following lines from your `~/.magmarc` file.
```
AttachSpec("<location>/TensorSpace/TensorSpace.spec");
```


## Feedback and Bugs

We welcome general feedback about the package and challenging examples. To report bugs, please create a [New Issue](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TensorSpace/issues/new) under the [Issues](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TensorSpace/issues) tab in the TameGenus repository, or @-mention any of the above contributors in your forked repository.
